Create pthreads
	- each philosopher is a thread

Routine


- philosophers - pthreads
- forks - mutexes - as many mutexes as philosophers


?
- What happens if there is only one philosopher? It dies once the time has expired.




each fork has a mutex.
thread checks for the mutex

if (i == 1)
philosopher 1 - fork n & 1

if (i > 1 && i < n)
philosopher i - fork i & n

if (i = n)
philosopher n - fork n & 1
